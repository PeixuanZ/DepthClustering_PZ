Main ideas: Clustering + depth

I. Connectivity-based clustering 
eg. hierarchical clustering, spectral clustering(?)

II Centroid-based clustering
eg. k-means

III distribution models (not discussed here)

IV desity clustering 
DBSCAN, OPTICS

There are 2 broad approaches for clustering:
1. Compactness: points that lie close to each other fall in the same cluster and are compact arount the cluster center, The closeness can be measured by the distance between the obeservation: K-means

2. Connectivity: Points that are connected or immediately next to each other are put in the same cluster. Even if the distance between 2 points is less, if they are not connected, they are not clustered together. Spectral clustering is a technique that follows this approach.
 
Paper:
Intro: Clustering+Depth
Then: Depth Based clustering(relative M depth + relative M-median depth)
Results: comparsions
Conclusions and future work: More data depth in depth based clustering
